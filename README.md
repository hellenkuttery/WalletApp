 - When the page loads, the load event listener retrieves the income and expense data from local storage, populates the expense table, sets the current date in the date input field, and updates the result table.
 - When the expense form is submitted, the event listener prevents the page from reloading, creates an expense object, adds it to the expense array, stores the array in local storage, populates the expense table, and updates the result table.
